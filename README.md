# overview-backend

Overview is an app that allows the user to keep track of their inventory. A shopping list is automatically generated based on item quantities that are less than their target quantities.

This is the backend portion of a full stack project. This is my first personal backend project outside of tutorials and courses. I used Express JS and implemented routes for GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. The database was built using SQLite.
